# CombDNF

Drug combinations are increasingly applied to treat a wide range of complex diseases. Drug action and thus also drug combination effects can differ between diseases, e.g., due to molecular differences. Therefore, disease-specific predictions are required for treatments. A plethora of methods based on cell-line screening data in cancer has been proposed. However, their extendability to other diseases is limited, as is their applicability in the clinical context due to the in-vivo-in-vitro gap. In contrast, only few approaches rely on clinically validated data.
Here, we propose CombDNF, a novel machine-learning based method for disease-specific drug combination prediction on clinically validated data. CombDNF is trained and predicts both on clinically approved (effective) and clinically reported adverse drug combinations from a broad collection of data sources. It can cope with the highly imbalanced label distribution in drug combination data. Further, CombDNF leverages network-derived features based on drug target and disease gene relationships. To incorporate uncertainty of the network topology it relies on edge weights in the underlying network.
